    "For the 4 species gff files store in the `data/` folder (mouse: `GRCm38.gff3`, human: `GRCh38.gff3`, zebrafish: `GRCz11.gff3` and panda: `AilMel.gff3`), load these files into a DataFrame, filter the exons, and calculate their length, their GC content as well as their molecular weigth. Store these calculations into new columns in their respective DataFrame. Plot these three values for the four species onto three graphs using a boxplot.\n",
