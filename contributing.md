## Steps for updating the course materials.
When updating and changing the content of the course in jupyter notebook, make sure:
- the course is not going to be ran tomorrow by someone else who is not aware of your changes
- your Jupyter notebook kernel is set to **Python3**
- you remove all outputs of cells before committing your code (except in very special circontances where you may wish to display the output)
  - Menu: Cell > All Outputs > Clear
- you update the installation instruction if you are using a new library
